Light Gradient Boosting Model? <br>
We've made a light gradient boosting model by coding it from scratch, that makes decisions based on multiple features. Right now what it can do is: <br>
<ul>
  <li> Input data from a CSV (such as): <br>
BMI,Age,Truth <br>
25,18,0 <br>
25,22,0 <br>
24,23,0 <br>
23,35,1 <br>
28,38,0 <br>
30,39,1 <br>
31,29,1 <br>
36,40,1 <br>
    Here truth would be something like: Has Cholestrol
  </li>
  <li>
    Train on this data that it has received (and we can see the final prediction made in the training phase)
  </li>
  <li>
    Make predictions on data within the extremes of the provided data. 
  </li>
  
</ul>
