        This was my first project at IITB. It was a team event hosted by the ERC club at the college - the aim was to make a car out of certain components that would be provided by the hosts, and it would be put to the test by an obstacle course. We were given a few brief lectures on the general construction of a car, and on the electronic componenets we'd need to attach. Our team (of 4) was named "Cotton Candy" üòÅ (courtesy of me wanting to eat cotton candy). We chose an acrylic frame for our car. We spent quite some time brainstorming and reading up about the past editions of XLR8, and on how to design our car to be collision proofed - going to the point of reading about the designs of ATVs (since we didn't quite know what to expect until the 2nd last day when the problem statement was released!). I think we had two weeks of time to deisgn our car - and we tried so many different ideas (one of them was a car made out of a foam board -we got suggested the material 'depron' by our mentors, if we wanted to try that. another was a car with 4 individual fragments - tied together by springs and rubber bands. Wild. I know.)
        <br>
        <br>
        This was the first project to teach me that theory and practice differ vastly. From spending a few sleepless nights in the tinkerer's laboratory, busy soldering connections on a perf board, to shorting our RPi pico by the end (whoops: RIP Rpi) - it was an eye opening experience. We even tried making a proper double wishbone suspension (Literally folding bicycle spokes into wishbones, getting springs and clamps from a hardware store ) - and nearly succeeded - until we realised that <em> it might have been way too overkill for the competition.</em> Plus, we didn't exactly have a way to test it either - so that was the halt for that.
        <br>
        <br>
        By the D-day, we had our car working. But the night prior to that? It was a spectacle - our car was working with the remote off - god knows how. Ghastly car? Anyways - during the competition we clocked on our first run at 6 min 28 seconds, and in the second run at 5 minutes (it was a best of two.) - which was among the 10 fastest times, from over 200 teams! It was an amazing experience overall.
