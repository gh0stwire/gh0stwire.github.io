        This was my first project at IITB. It was a team event hosted by the ERC club at the college - the aim was to make a car out of certain components that would be provided by the hosts, and it would be put to the test by an obstacle course. We were given a few brief lectures on the general construction of a car, and on the electronic componenets we'd need to attach. Our team (of 4) was named "Cotton Candy" üòÅ (courtesy of me wanting to eat cotton candy). We chose an acrylic frame for our car. We spent quite some time brainstorming and reading up about the past editions of XLR8, and on how to design our car to be collision proofed - going to the point of reading about the designs of ATVs (since we didn't quite know what to expect until the 2nd last day when the problem statement was released!). I think we had two weeks of time to deisgn our car - and we tried so many different ideas (one of them was a car made out of a foam board -we got suggested the material 'depron' by our mentors, if we wanted to try that. another was a car with 4 individual fragments - tied together by springs and rubber bands. Wild. I know.)

        This was the first project to teach me that theory and practice differ vastly. From spending a few sleepless nights in the tinkerer's laboratory, busy soldering connections on a perf board, to shorting our RPi pico by the end (whoops: RIP Rpi) - it was an eye opening experience. We even tried making a proper double wishbone suspension (Literally folding bicycle spokes into wishbones, getting springs and clamps from a hardware store ) - and nearly succeeded - until we realised that <em> it might have been way too overkill for the competition.</em> Plus, we didn't exactly have a way to test it either - so that was the halt for that.

        By the D-day, we had our car working. But the night prior to that? It was a spectacle - our car was working with the remote off - god knows how. Ghastly car? Anyways - during the competition we clocked on our first run at 6 min 28 seconds, and in the second run at 5 minutes (it was a best of two.) - which was among the 10 fastest times, from over 200 teams! It was an amazing experience overall.

        RC Airplane Competition
      </h1>

        This was my second project at IITB. We had gone to attend the orientation for the event, and well - instantly, it had my interest. As a kid, I used to have a lot of fascination with planes, and that part of me couldn't possibly be happier - the fact that we'd get to build our plane with some guidance! We were given the task of making a simple glider at the end of the orientation, in which we (more or less) succeeded. We had a team of four, and our team was named 'The Wrong Brothers' initially, but... That didn't quite sit well. So we changed our team name to "The Happy Mosquito" (Owing to the buzzing sound the motor would make). After a short while of realizing that our brainstorming and realizing that it usually leads to overkill plans, we settled for something simple: We'd follow the design of an F22. We found a template online, marked our depron sheets, and got to work - and aesthetic wise, our plane looked amazing. Now all that remained was the actualy flying part... 
        <br>
        <br>
        We headed to the Tinkerer's laboratory, and under the guidance of our mentors, we started assembling the components piece by piece - the brushless DC motors, the components responsible for connecting with the remote etc. Our plane had a few fundamental design differences though - In a basic plane, there are two separate components to generate lift (Ailerons) , and to steer the plane (Elevators). Our plane had a combined version, called Elevons. Furthermore, we didn't really give an airfoil shape to the wing of our plane (bad decision, in hindsight. But in theory it would work - based on a few other videos we found on the net.) We had a few simulator sessions, in which we 'flew' RC planes on our laptops with a controller. And then came the actual trial runs with our planes.
        <br>
        <br>
        In our first runs, we realised a few problems - the wings weren't wide enough to be able to support the entire plane, and the motor wasn't generating enough speed to get the required lift. We were told later that having separate ailerons and elevators would have been a fix. So we tried - we added more depron to the wings to increase the wing area, (also giving it an airfoil shape in the process.) But alas, the motor still wasn't sufficient... And although we may not have succeded in making a working, flying plane, we sure did build one cool looking glider! It was a fun learning experience. :D
